## Folder Responsibilities

### `src/app/` (routing shell only)
- Contains: `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `loading.tsx`, `error.tsx`, route composition, metadata.
- Rules:
  - Keep pages/layouts thin.
  - No feature business logic (domain calculations, feature state, API orchestration) in `app/`.
  - `app/` may import from `features/*`, `shared/*`, and `components/ui/*`.
  - `features/*` must never import from `app/`.

### `src/features/` (business ownership)
- Organize by ecommerce domain: `auth`, `cart`, `checkout`, `products`, `categories`, `home`, `navigation`, etc.
- Each feature may contain (as needed): `components/`, `hooks/`, `services/`, `store/`, `types.ts`, `utils.ts`, `constants.ts`.
- Rules:
  - Prefer colocation: put feature UI + state + services together.
  - Feature code can import from `shared/*` and `components/ui/*`.
  - Cross-feature imports are allowed, but prefer the owning feature’s public surface:
    - Prefer `src/features/<feature>/index.ts` over deep internal paths.

### `src/components/ui/` (presentational primitives only)
- Only reusable primitives: `Button`, `Input`, `Modal`, `Badge`, `Sheet`, `Skeleton`, etc.
- Rules:
  - No business logic, no API calls, no feature stores.
  - Can depend on `shared/utils` (e.g. `cn`) and styling libraries.
  - Must not import from `features/*`.

### `src/shared/` (generic reusable infrastructure)
- Put things here only when they are genuinely cross-feature and non-domain:
  - API/fetch clients, generic hooks, formatting helpers, shared constants, shared base types.
- Rules:
  - `shared/*` must not import from `features/*`.
  - If the code “speaks ecommerce” (cart totals, product pricing rules), it belongs in that feature.

### `src/stores/` (global cross-feature state)
- Only for state shared across multiple features (rare).
- Rules:
  - Feature-specific stores live in `src/features/<feature>/store/`.
  - Avoid turning `src/stores` into a dumping ground.

### `src/i18n/`
- Owns i18n routing, locale-aware Link/navigation helpers, and request config.
- Rules:
  - Domain translations/messages stay in `messages/*.json`.

## Page Composition Philosophy

Pages in `src/app/` should mostly compose feature-level “page components”.

Example:
```ts
// src/app/[locale]/page.tsx
import { HomePage } from "@/features/home";

export default function Page() {
  return <HomePage />;
}
```

## Shared vs Feature: How to Decide

Put it in a **feature** when:
- It’s tied to a domain (cart, checkout, auth, products, categories).
- It changes when that domain evolves.
- It uses feature state, feature services, or feature-specific types.

Put it in **shared** when:
- It’s infrastructure (API client), a generic helper (`cn`, `formatMoney`), or cross-feature types (`ApiResponse`).
- It has no knowledge of ecommerce concepts.

Put it in **components/ui** when:
- It’s a pure presentational primitive with no domain ownership.
- It can be used anywhere without importing business logic.

## Ecommerce Examples (Where New Code Goes)

- Add “Wishlist”:
  - `src/features/wishlist/components/WishlistButton.tsx`
  - `src/features/wishlist/store/useWishlistStore.ts`
  - `src/features/wishlist/services/wishlistService.ts`

- Add a product card:
  - `src/features/products/components/ProductCard.tsx` (domain-owned)
  - Generic primitives used by the card (e.g. `Button`) go in `src/components/ui/`.

- Add cart totals logic:
  - `src/features/cart/utils/calcCartTotals.ts`

- Add an API client wrapper:
  - `src/shared/lib/api.ts`

- Add category tree types:
  - `src/features/categories/types.ts`

## Anti-Patterns (Do Not Do)

- Putting domain logic in `src/app/` (pages/layouts become “god components”).
- Creating global folders by file type (e.g. `src/services/*`, `src/hooks/*`) instead of feature ownership.
- A giant `shared/components` dumping ground.
- Feature stores placed in `src/stores/`.
- Deep cross-feature imports into another feature’s internals (prefer feature public exports).
- Deep route-only component folders that duplicate features (keep folders shallow).
